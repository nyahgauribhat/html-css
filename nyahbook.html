<h3> in my free time, i love to..</h3>
<ol type = "i.">
<li> read fictional romance novels</li>
<li> run through trees, just after the dew has collected</li>
<li> bang the ebony and ivory, belting melodies which resonate through the room </li>
<li> aimlessly scroll through youtube links of open heart surgeries, watching these for hours</li>
<li> canter through the sand on the back of a warmblood</li>
<li>find an intersectionality between arbritary, juxtaposed ideas and see how they blend together</li>
<li> use my voice to fight for the dying trees, elephants, and the cacaphony of tucans </li>

</ol>

<h3 id ="goals"> my goals for the future is to become a person who..</h3>
<ul>
    <li> lives to live</li>
    <li> stands up for their rights</li>
    <li> shows fervent passion in whatever task i may take on</li>
    <li> engages in the community, connects, and bridges divides</li>
    <li> finds happiness in everyday, in the little and larger things</li>
    <li> leaves an unfading footprint on the world, changing it for the better</li>
</ul>
